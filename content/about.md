# About MMCAL

We are the **Multimedia Computing and AI Lab (MMCAL)**, from  [the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China.

We are focusing on the **multimedia/multimodal information processing theories**, **methods**, and **applications (especially immersive media communication and autonomous unmanned systems)**.

### Multimedia Coding and Processing

- Multimedia Coding (3D Point Cloud Coding, Image/Video Coding, Deep Learning-Based Coding, Human and Machine Perception-Driven Coding)
- Multimedia Quality Assessment and Enhancement
- 3D Gaussian Splatting for Reconstruction/Compression/Rendering/Generation/Representation

### 3D Vision Applications

- 3D Vision and Multimodal Learning in Immersive Media (VR/AR) and Unmanned Systems (Autonomous Driving, Robotics, UAV Navigation) 
- Applications of Generative AI, World Model, and Multimodal Large Model
