# About MMCAL

We are the **Multimedia Computing and AI Lab Group**, from  [the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China.

We are focusing on the **multimedia/multimodal information processing theories**, **methods**, and **applications (especially immersive media communication and autonomous unmanned systems)**.

### Multimedia Coding and Processing

- Multimedia Coding (3D Point Cloud Coding, Image/Video Coding, Deep Learning-Based Coding, Human and Machine Perception-Driven Coding)
- Multimedia Quality Assessment and Enhancement
- 3D Gaussian Splatting for Reconstruction/Compression/Rendering/Generation/Representation

### 3D Vision and Multimodal Learning

- 3D Vision and Multimodal Learning in Unmanned Systems (Autonomous Driving, Robotics, UAV Navigation)
- Applications of Multimodal Large Model and Generative AI

### Other Research Topics

- Saliency Segmentation for RGB-D/RGB-T/Light Field/Point Cloud (See TPAMI 2023: A Thorough Benchmark and A New Model for Light Field Saliency Detection)
- Model Compression and Acceleration (See IJCV 2024: Interpretable Task-inspired Adaptive Filter Pruning for Neural Networks Under Multiple Constraints)
- FPGA/ASIC and Embedded Systems (See ACM MM 2023: OpenHardwareVC: An Open Source Library for 8K UHD Video Coding Hardware Implementation)
- Open Source Projects (See ACM MM 2022: OpenPointCloud: An Open-Source Algorithm Library of Deep Learning Based Point Cloud Compression)
