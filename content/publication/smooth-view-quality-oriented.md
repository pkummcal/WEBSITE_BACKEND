abstract = "View level bit allocation is an fundamental optimization problem in multiview video plus depth (MVD) based 3D video coding (3DVC). In this paper, we propose a smooth view quality oriented view level bit allocation framework for MVD based 3DVC. The Cauchy-density based rate-distortion model of the texture video and depth map are employed to represent the rate distortion properties. The relationship between the distortion of synthesized view and quantization step size of texture videos and depth maps is approximately fitted as linear model. Final, the bit allocation problem is solved by convex optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm can achieve good performance with acceptable computational complexity comparing to the full search scheme."
