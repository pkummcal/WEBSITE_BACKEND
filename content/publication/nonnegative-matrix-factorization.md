abstract = "Community structure is the most significant attribute of networks, which is often identified to help discover the underlying organization of networks. Currently, nonnegative matrix [factorization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/factorization) (NMF) based community detection method makes use of the related topology information and assumes that networks are able to be projected onto a latent low-dimensional space, in which the nodes can be efficiently clustered. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named mixed [hypergraph](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/hypergraph) regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (MHGNMF), which takes higher-order information among the nodes into consideration to enhance the clustering performance. The hypergraph [regularization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/regularization) term forces the nodes within the identical [hyperedge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/hyperedges) to be projected onto the same latent [subspace](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subspace), so that a more discriminative representation is achieved. In the proposed framework, we generate a set of hyperedges by mixing two kinds of neighbors for each [centroid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/centroid), which makes full use of topological connection information and structural similarity information. By testing on two artificial benchmarks and eight real-world networks, the proposed framework demonstrates better detection results than the other [state-of-the-art methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/state-of-the-art-method)."
